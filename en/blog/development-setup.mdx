Every software developer has its set of routines how to work best. In the following sections, I want to describe to you my current setup and which software/programs I need to write web application. Perhaps you can find something useful to improve your setup. If you have better solutions to the described challenges, I‚Äôm excited to hear about it.

## Hardware

During my years at university, I fell in love with [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and the [i3](https://i3wm.org/) window manager. Every program had its shortcuts and virtual desktop. After graduating, I realized that, at least in Germany, Microsoft‚Äôs office products are a hard requirement for many employers, so that I couldn‚Äôt use my favourite distro any more, due to the lack of support for the required software. After more than a year of fighting with Windows, I bought myself a 14‚Äù MacBook Pro with an Apple M1 Pro chip and 32¬†GB memory. It‚Äôs the solution for having a Unix based operating system and using Microsoft‚Äôs office products, which I need for work.

## Code Editor

As a full-stack developer, I tried different code editors from [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) Ultimate for Java Backend, [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) for SQL databases, to [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for large enterprise Angular Applications, but eventually, I chose [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for all my work due to the fact of its large catalogue of wonderful extensions. Every frontend application uses different frameworks, code styles and software solutions (e.g. E2E testing: Playwright/Cypress‚Ä¶). Therefore, it made sense for me to use the editor with the highest amount of flexibility to adjust to different projects. Besides the general extensions of Visual Studio Code‚Äôs Language Server to get the support for Angular, React, Svelte, Prettier or ESLint, I want to highlight the following as valuable companions:

- **[Console Ninja](https://github.com/wallabyjs/console-ninja)**

  If you often jump between your source code and the console of your browser, then Console Ninja is the extension you have to install. In short, it brings the console log directly into your source code. I caught myself multiple times seeing some error (displayed by Console Ninja) in my source code, which I would have missed because I didn‚Äôt open the Browser‚Äôs console.

- **[Pretty TypeScript Errors](https://github.com/yoavbls/pretty-ts-errors)**

  Imagine you are writing a complex RxJS chain of operators and suddenly Typescript points to you a type mismatch. But it is not your usual ‚Äúnumber cannot be a string‚Äù error, but a large undecipherable message. For example, see the following two images from the same code location.

- **[Turbo Console Log](https://github.com/Chakroun-Anas/turbo-console-log)**

  If you quickly want to observe some values in your code, it is much easier to write a short `console.log` to print the desired value, instead of opening the debugger tab in your browser. But sadly, your logs often times only contain the attribute itself, or only a quick word to find the right log in your console. Turbo Console is adding a shortcut to create a console log for a specific attribute with a nicely formatted message, so that you can easily find it or filter for it in your browsers console. The following code snippet shows the outcome for the parameter ‚Äúname‚Äù.

  ```ts
  function buildGreeting(name: string): string {
    console.log("TURBO ~ file: example.ts:2 ~ buildGreeting ~ name:", name);
    return `Hi ${name}`;
  }
  ```

### Vim

I keep it short. I used Vim as my editor of choice at university, and I like the approach of the various keyboard modes. Therefore, I use in all of my editors and IDE‚Äôs extensions ([extension](https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim) for Visual Studio Code) to have an emulated Vi experience. If you are eager to learn how to use this kind of layout, I highly recommend this [VIM Fundamentals](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/vim-fundamentals/) course.

### MonoLisa

Since I‚Äôm staring more than 8h a day at my computer monitor, I often asked myself which font I should use. After some reading, I tried the [MonoLisa](https://www.monolisa.dev/) font and I really liked it. I didn‚Äôt experience less fatigue, but I appreciate to have a font for my editor, which I didn‚Äôt find everywhere around the World Wide Web.

## Git

From the beginning of my software developing journey, I used Git. Handing in some assignments for university courses or working on large code bases with multiple team members at my current job, Git is everywhere. At the start, I used the terminal, since I only had to do some simple commit, push and pull operations. After some painful situations to squash multiple commits and merge conflicts, I went to a graphical solution. If you are using a JetBrains product like e.g. IntelliJ, the provided Git client will solve your problems with charm. In my current setup with Visual Studio Code, I‚Äôm using [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) with the Pro plan. I had a steep learning curve to use GitKraken, but in the end I really like the graphical reprensentation of the active branches, if many developers are working in the same repository.

## Shell

I don‚Äôt have a strong opinion on shells (except not to use Microsoft‚Äôs PowerShell üòâ). I‚Äôm currently using macOS‚Äô default z-shell with [ohh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh), [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) as theme and [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) as my terminal emulator.

## Database Server

For local development, I always have one [PostgreSQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) and one [DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.DownloadingAndRunning.html) database running. They spin up after I log into my user account. Both are running as docker containers with persistent volumes. This makes it straightforward to maintain their versioning without installing them directly to my system. Furthermore, I know that I always have a database server ready when I need it.
