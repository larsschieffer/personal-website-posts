description: Who am I and how I became a Software Developer
---

My absolute passion lies in creating products that make our everyday
lives easier. I detest nothing more than doing the same things over
and over again.

<br />
Now, unfortunately, I have two left hands when it comes to topics like electrical
circuits or creating inventions like washing machines or dishwashers. Fortunately,
through my skills as a software developer, I can enable digital products that take
work off our hands or offer exciting tasks in our spare time. So far, I have been
able to solve manually complex tasks through a time-tracking calendar, the easy recording
of card game results and improving the product for registering damages in windscreens.
I‚Äôm really lucky that all the different groups I worked with had a great team spirit.
Everyone was able to contribute his/her strengths to improve the products so that
they can be loved by thousands of users today.
<br />
To be always able to find the best solutions for emerging challenges, continuous
training is essential for me because the focus is always on creating the best product
for the customer. Frameworks for the frontend or backend are always just tools, so
the highest interest for myself is to be able to handle them competently. Therefore,
it doesn‚Äôt matter if the product uses Angular, React, Vue, Svelte, ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm in!
<br />
To create exciting applications again and again, it is important to think outside
the box of software development. I love to explore the world! Travelling together
with my wife always gives us new impressions. During my studies of computer science,
I became a little bookworm, so you will find me on the weekend with a cup of hot
tea and a good book or ‚ÄúThe Economist‚Äù.
