## The reason

In general, I would rather not repeat myself. Occasionally, it happens that I'm developing on a small hobby project and I need a database to implement a needed feature. In those situations, I would rather not waste any time of setting up a database server. Therefore, I decided to always have a PostgreSQL database server running. The whole server should be quick to setup and easy to maintain, such that I don't have to deal with it in the future again. In the end, I chose a containerized solution, which I want to share with you right now.

## Why Should You Use A Container?

The latest trends of cloud native development allow to easily start software on any operating system. It doesn't matter whether you are using Linux, macOS or Windows. The following setup works for all of them. You can easily change your database server, change their release versions or you can change your operating system. Overall, it made sense to me to have an operating system agnostic solution because then I can be sure that the database connection will even work after a deployment, too.

## Prerequisites

You only need two things to go along with this guide. The first one is that you have to have a running container engine. The guide uses docker, but everything I show you should work for e.g. podman, too. Furthermore, you should know a bit of how to navigate with your terminal. With that said, let's start setting up your database environment.

## Why Should You Use A Docker-Compose File?

Normally, you don't need a docker compose file for a single docker container. But, the maintainability is so much better than using a long, not understandable docker command. Additionally, you can add the docker-compose file to your version control system, such that everybody of your team can use it.

### The Docker-Compose File

Now, let's start to create your `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content.

```yml
version: "3.8"

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:alpine
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db:
    driver: local
```

- The **postgres:alpine** image contains a small [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) distribution with a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database server. Therefore, the overall container size stays in its appropriate limits.
- With **always** as **restart policy**, the container automatically starts without a manual step from your side.
- The environment variables `POSTGRES_USER=postgres` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres` are used to create a database user with **postgres** as username and **postgres** as password.
- The **5432:5432** port mapping allows the access to the database server inside the container on port **5432** on your local machine, without further configuration
- If you update your database server, you don't want to lose your development data. Volumes allow having persistent data between container runs. You would rather not share those volumes with other services, so that a **local** driver is sufficient. The volume **db** persists the content of the directory `/var/lib/postgresql/data` in the container, which is the data location for PostgreSQL.

### Starting Your Docker-Compose Setup

Finally, you can start the docker-compose setup with the following command:

```sh
$ docker compose up -d                                                 ‚úò INT

```

## Create Your Database

Let's create the first database together. Therefore, you need to know the name of the running database server container. You can find its name with the following command:

```sh
$ docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}\t{{.Image}}"
NAMES             PORTS                    IMAGE
postgresql-db-1   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp   postgres:alpine
```

You can see that the container has the name **postgresql-db-1**. Connecting inside the container works as follows:

```sh
$ docker exec -it postgresql-db-1 psql  -U postgres
psql (15.3)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

And finally, you can create your database:

```sh
postgres=# create database <NAME_OF_YOUR_DB>;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=#
```

You are done üëè! You created a containerised database server, which you can use for your applications. If you used the same values in the `docker-compose.yml` from the previous section, the following works to connect the application with the database:

```
postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/<NAME_OF_YOUR_DB>
```

## Always Running

If you want to have your database server always running, you have to make sure to that the container engine automatically starts after you log in. If you are using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) you can tick the checkbox next to **"Start Docker Desktop when you log in"** in the **General** settings of the application to achieve this.

## Maintaining Your Database Server

You already achieved to have a running database server. But after some months, you want to update the server to the latest version, without losing the data of your applications. This can be done with the following three steps.

### Stop Your Docker-Compose Network

```sh
$ docker compose down
[+] Running 2/1
 ‚úî Container postgresql-db-1   Removed  0.1s
 ‚úî Network postgresql_default  Removed  0.0s
```

### Remove The Old Container Image

```sh
$ docker image rm "postgres:alpine"
Untagged: postgres:alpine
Untagged: postgres@sha256:48d8422c6ae570a5bda52f07548b8e65dd055ac0b661f25b44b20e8cff2f75f0

### Start The Docker-Compose Network again

```sh
$ docker compose up -d                                                 ‚úò INT

```

And that's it. You successfully updated your database server to the latest version without losing your data.

### All together

Finally, you can combine those three steps in a single command so that you don't need to wait for each step to finish.

```sh
$ docker compose down \
&& docker image rm "postgres:alpine" \
&& docker compose up -d
```

## Summary

This post was all about setting up a database server for your local development. You can use it for all your projects, which need a database, without any further configuration. In the example above, I used PostgreSQL as my database server, but you can easily achieve the same results with [DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.DownloadingAndRunning.html) or [MongoDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/).
